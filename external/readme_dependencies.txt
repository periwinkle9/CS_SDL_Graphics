This project requires the following dependencies (not included with this repo):
- SDL2 (https://www.libsdl.org/)
- Freetype (https://freetype.org/)
- stb_image (https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
- The "doukutsu" folder from https://github.com/periwinkle9/CSCustomDLLTemplate
  (sorry, I'll split that into a separate git repo and submodule someday).

Place the headers and library files in the appropriate subdirectories of this folder
before compiling. Make sure that they're compiled for x86!
